# Getting Started

This guide explains how to use Falcon for Ruby web application development.

## Falcon Serve

You can run `falcon serve` directly. It will load the `config.ru` and start serving on `https://localhost:9292`.

To run on a different port:

~~~ bash
$ falcon serve --port 3000
~~~

### Integration with Guard

Falcon can restart very quickly and is ideal for use with guard. See [guard-falcon] for more details.

### Integration with Capybara

Falcon can run in the same process on a different thread, so it's great for use with Capybara (and shared ActiveRecord transactions). See [falcon-capybara] for more details.

### Using with Rackup

You can invoke Falcon via `rackup`:

~~~ bash
$ rackup --server falcon
~~~

This will run a single-threaded instance of Falcon using `http/1`. While it works fine, it's not recommended to use `rackup` with `falcon`, because performance will be limited.

### Self-Signed TLS with Curl

In order to use `curl` with self-signed localhost certificates, you need to specify `--insecure` or the path of the certificate to validate the request:

~~~
> curl -v https://localhost:9292 --cacert ~/.localhost/localhost.crt
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
